Just to make sure:
The syntax file and this help text come with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY!
If you destroy your system, don't come whining to me.


--------------------
 systemwide install
--------------------

1) Copy the syntax file to the correct directory by typing:
cp acme.jsf /etc/joe/syntax/

2) Add the following lines to the "SECOND SECTION" of "/etc/joe/joerc":

*.a
-indentc 9
-istep 1
-autoindent
-syntax acme

3) done!


--------------
 user install
--------------

1) Copy the syntax file to the correct directory by typing:
mkdir -p ~/.joe/syntax
cp acme.jsf ~/.joe/syntax/

2) If you do not have a ~/.joerc file yet, create one by typing:
if [ -e ~/.joerc ] ; then echo :include /etc/joe/joerc > ~/.joerc ; fi

3) Add the following lines to the "SECOND SECTION" of your .joerc file:

*.a
-indentc 9
-istep 1
-autoindent
-syntax acme

4) done!


---------
 testing
---------

After installing the syntax file, open the file "color.a" in joe to
check whether it works (and to see what it looks like).
