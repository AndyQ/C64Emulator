                ...source code file converter for ACME


Compiling and installing the executable
---------------------------------------

Change into the directory "toacme/src" that was created when
unpacking the archive and simply type "make". This will compile the
sources and produce an executable file.

If you have root access:
Change into superuser mode using "su" and type "make install" to move
the executable to the appropriate directory (system-wide install).

If you don't have root access:
Type "make userinstall" to move the executable to your "~/bin"
directory (user-specific install)

Feel free to adjust the Makefile to your specific needs.
