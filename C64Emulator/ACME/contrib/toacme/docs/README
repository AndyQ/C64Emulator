Introduction
------------

ToACME is a file converter for the ACME crossassembler. It is meant to
be a helpful tool for people switching from using another assembler to
using ACME. In such cases, ToACME can be used to convert the source
code files to ACME format.


Syntax and use
--------------

./toacme  FORMAT_ID  INPUT_FILE  OUTPUT_FILE

Calling ToACME without any arguments will show a short message
containing copyright information and a list of all known input
formats.

If called with three arguments, ToACME will interpret the first one
as the format ID. It will then try to convert the input file,
writing the result to the output file.

Please keep in mind that this program cannot cope with *all*
features other assemblers may use. So after having converted your
sources, don't delete the original ones!

Make sure the conversion worked by assembling the new sources using
ACME and then comparing the resulting binaries with the ones your
previous assembler produced.


Known input formats
-------------------

Currently, ToACME supports these input file formats:

Format ID:  source file format             quality
--------------------------------------------------
object      object code files                 poor
hypra       C64: Hypra-Assembler                ok
giga        C64: Giga-Assembler                 ok
vis         C64: VisAss                   untested
ab3         C64: AssBlaster 3.0 to 3.2        good
f8ab        C64: Flash8-AssBlaster              ok
prof        C64: Professional Assembler       poor (work in progress)
