             * will use a timer counter to count how many 0s it has read. Every
             * 4 read bits, it will detect a 1-bit, because it doesn't
             * distinguish between reset occuring from magnetic flux or regular
             * wraparound.
             * 
             * Random magnetic flux events can also occur after GCR data has been
             * quiet for a long time, for at least 4 bits. So the first value
             * read will always be 1. Afterwards, the 0-bit sequence lengths
             * vary randomly, but can never exceed 3.
             * 
             * Each time a random event happens, it tends to advance the bit counter
             * by half a clock, because the random event can occur at any time
             * and thus the expectation value is that it occurs at 50 % point
             * within the bitcells.
             * 
             * Additionally, the underlying disk rotation has no way to keep in sync
             * with the electronics, so the bitstream after a GCR=0 may or may not
             * be shifted with respect to the bit counter by the time drive
             * encounters it. This situation will persist until the next sync
             * sequence. There is no specific emulation for variable disk rotation,
             * this case is thought to be covered by the random event handling.
             * 
             * Here's some genuine 1541 patterns for reference:
