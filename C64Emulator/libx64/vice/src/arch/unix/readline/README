$Revision: 1.5 $

This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any
program to provide command-line editing and recall.

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library, but it is a
fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).  It does not use
standard I/O.  It is distributed under a "C News-like" copyright.

Configuration is done in the Makefile.  Type "make testit" to get
a small slow shell for testing.

An earlier version was distributed with Byron's rc.  Principal
changes over that version include:
	Faster.
	Is eight-bit clean (thanks to brendan@cs.widener.edu)
	Written in K&R C, but ANSI compliant (gcc all warnings)
	Propagates EOF properly; rc trip test now passes
	Doesn't need or use or provide memmove.
	More robust
	Calling sequence changed to be compatible with readline.
	Test program, new manpage, better configuration
	More system-independant; includes Unix and OS-9 support.

Enjoy,
