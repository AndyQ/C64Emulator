/*

    The PET CPU clock is exactly (within chip tolerances) 1MHz
    (16.0Mhz / 16 or 8.0Mhz / 8 = 1.0Mhz).

    The screen's "50Hz" or "60Hz" are actually derived from this clock by
    counting cycles in the CRTC.

    The 50 resp. 60Hz interrupt is triggered by the vertical sync signal.
    Which in turn is derived from the CPU clock by the CRTC counting an
    appropriate number of cycles.

    Only the ROMs are different for 60Hz and 50Hz machines

    The 50Hz machines (at least some) have a ROM with 313 lines with 64
    cycles each, which result in about 20ms screen time - thus 50Hz.

    PAL defines 313 rasterlines for one half-image (actually 625 per full
    image) with 64us (i.e. 64 cycles) per rasterline. That results in 20032
    cycles per screen - 49.920Hz. The second half-image is defined as 312
    raster lines, which makes 19968 cycles - 50.080 Hz. Both together
    are 40000 cycles for two screens.

/* NOTE: Except for the exact CYCLES_PER_SEC those are only reasonable defaults.
         They get overwritten when writing to the CRTC (usually by the editor ROM).
         they are defined here for reference, and to initialize the emulation
         with reasonable defaults when needed.
