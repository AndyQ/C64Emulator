/*
 * This is the header for the RS232 emulation.
 *
 * The RS232 emulation captures the bytes sent to the RS232 interfaces
 * available (currently only ACIA 6551, later UART 16550A, std C64,
 * and Daniel Dallmanns fast RS232 with 9600 Baud).
 * The characters captured are displayed in a special terminal window.
 * Characters typed in the terminal window are sent back to the
 * chip emulations.
