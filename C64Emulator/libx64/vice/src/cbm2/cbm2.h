    the C6x0/C7x0 series has a CRTC
    - cpu clock is 18.0Mhz / 9 = 2.0Mhz

    "The kernal is identical. The video initialization depends on
     two input signals on one of the 6525 chips. One switches between PAL and NTSC
     (and also between 50 and 60 Hz), the other between internal (CBM 7x0) and
     external (CBM 6x0) monitor."
*/

/* NOTE: Except for the exact CYCLES_PER_SEC those are only reasonable defaults.
         They get overwritten when writing to the CRTC (usually by the kernal).
         they are defined here for reference, and to initialize the emulation
         with reasonable defaults when needed.

/* FIXME: handshake with a 2031 disk drive has a timing issue, where
   the CBM-II is slightly too fast. Reducing speed for about 1.3% from
   the real 2MHz seems to help here...
