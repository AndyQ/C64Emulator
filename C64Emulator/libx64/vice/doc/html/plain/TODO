What are we going to do next (or not)
=====================================

* General improvements
----------------------

- Write real MS-DOS and Win32 documentation (any volunteers?).

- Allow tape loading without the virtually pressed "Play" button,
  which can break some programs that do not like it to be pressed
  (e.g. Turbo Assembler).

- Emulate shifted keys more accurately by delaying the shifted key
  after the shift.

- Emulate the RESTORE key more accurately.

- Some more Kernal patches, for instance for changing colors and
  patching the reset routine to make it faster (maybe configurable).

- Improve sound snapshot.

- Add some wishlist.

* C128 improvements
-------------------

- Support for fast mode (2MHz).

* VIC20 improvements
--------------------

- Improve the accuracy of the audio emulation.

* PET improvements
------------------

- Reimplement the CRTC caching functionality

* CBM-II improvements
------------------

- Reimplement the CRTC caching functionality

* Plus/4
--------

* Drive improvements
--------------------

  disk drive emulation.
