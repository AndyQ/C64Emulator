Compiling VICE on Linux with Mingw32
====================================

you need a working mingw32 installation, and the directx header files. you should
have a look at your distributions repositories first, and install their respective
packages if available. if they are not, you may want to look at the mingw32 
buildscript: vice/build/mingw32/build-cross.sh

i recommend doing the following on a fresh svn checkout, or atleast a sourcetree
which has been cleaned from old .o and .a files.

first run autogen to generate the configuration scripts:

$ ./autogen.sh

now, if you have a sane system-wide mingw32 install, the following configure line
should work:

$ ./configure --host mingw32 --with-resid --enable-ethernet --enable-fullscreen

if it does not, which will be the case if mingw32 is not installed system-wide
and/or the mingw32 binaries can not be found in your path environment, then 
something like the following is required:

$ MINGW="/path/to/mingw32/bin/mingw32-" \
WINDRES="$MINGW""windres" \
WRC="$WINDRES" \
AR="$MINGW""ar" \
RANLIB="$MINGW""ranlib" \
LD="$MINGW""ld" \
CC="$MINGW""gcc" \
CXX="$MINGW""g++" \
./configure --host mingw32 --with-resid --enable-ethernet --enable-fullscreen

after that finished, you can simply run "make" to create the binaries:

$ make

and last not least, create a proper vice binary directory tree from which you
could run the executables:

$ make bindist
