Building the SDL port of VICE:

Building in *nix compile enviroments
------------------------------------

./configure --enable-sdlui
make
make install

You'll need the SDL libs and headers. For free scaling, the OpenGL is
also needed (libGL, opengl32.dll, ...). Movie recording needs the
FFMPEG libraries and headers.


Building in Visual Studio
-------------------------

To build SDL VICE in Windows with Visual C/C++, you will need to get the VC SDL
headers and libraries (http://www.libsdl.org/).

Once you have downloaded the VC SDL headers and libraries you need to make a
directory for them to reside in, you can do this in the following way:

- Make an SDL_dev directory and inside that directory make two new directories, one
  called SDL (for the headers) and one called SDL_libs (for the libraries).
- Move the files from the include directory of the downloaded SDL VC file to the
  SDL_dev/SDL directory.
- Move the files from the lib directory of the downloaded SDL VC file to the
  SDL_dev/libs directory.

Now you need to configure your VC to use those directories to find the
headers and libraries, you can do this in the following way:

- Start your Visual C/C++.
- Go to the menu 'tools' and click on the item 'options'.
- In the dialog window click on the tab 'directories'.
- For 'Include files' add the path to SDL_dev to the list.
- For 'Library files' add the path to SDL_dev/libs to the list.

From now on your VC will be set up to search through these directories for
the headers and libraries.

Now you can open the vice.dsw file and compile VICE.

To make a binary distribution directory after a compile of VICE you can
use the 'make-bindist.bat' file.
